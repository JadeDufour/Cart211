                <p>First Impressions are important! Each wedding is unique and beautiful in their own way. However, they all have a few things in common for instance the centerpieces, the decor, the invitation cards and of course the photographs. <br><br></p>
               
            </div>

                <h5>General Organization</h5><br>
                <p>

                    Centerpieces as well as the decor are always different in every wedding. Each couple has their own taste and style. “Marry Us” offers various options such as flowers, candles, vases, plants and so on. The decor revolves around the centerpieces as it is harder to find and create. Regarding the decor, couples have a list of styles and themes to choose from such as beach, bohemian, vintage, modern and so on. We have endless possibilities for our clients to have the wedding of their dreams. Whatever you desire, we deliver. <br><br>
                    
                    The first impression guests will have from your wedding are the invitation cards. They are as well one of the aspects of the wedding you will keep and frame. Therefore, it needs to be perfect. The design will be based on the wedding theme you choose. Recently we added a new feature to our invitation cards. They can be printed out or sent digitally depending on your preference. The cards can be different sizes, shapes and forms. We offer many different samples we’ve done in the past and we are open to new ideas!<br><br>
                    
                    We all want to document this magical day! What better way to do so then to photograph it. Our photographers and videographers offer many ways of capturing your event. They make printed wedding albums, wedding videos (can come in different formats) and many others. Do contact our team for more information regarding the Photographer and Videographers. <br><br>

                <h5>Venue</h5><br>
                <p>When planning an event, the first thing we need is a location that is suitable for the number of guests you are having as well as the type of event. We provide our clients with a list of venues that best suit your wedding whether it is an outdoor space, a religious temple or a ballroom hall. This decision is based on your budget, the number of guests, the location and the wedding theme.</p> <br><br>

                 <h5>Food</h5><br>

             <p>Guests often remember a wedding not only by its decor, but by its menu. The food is very important in any event. Therefore we want to ensure that everyone is satisfied, which is why we offer different menus as we know everyone comes from different cultures an   backgrounds. Besides the usual menus as in the kids and adult menu, couples have a choice between vegan, vegetarian, kosher and halal meals. Depending on the type of food our clients want, we have different caterers. In the past, our clients have chosen food from Middle Eastern to Asian to Italian. Our clients have unlimited choices they can choose from.

                    Priyanka Chopa starred in many American films. However, her fame blew up when she took on the role of “Alex Parish” in Quantico in 2015. <br><br>
