                <h1>Our company</h1><br>
                <p>“Marry Us” was founded in 1960 in Montreal, Quebec. It all began with a couple by the name of Mr. and Mrs. Johnson who needed help planning their wedding. Their close friend Betty Anderson agreed to take care of it to relieve their stress. Anderson put together the most beautiful and heartwarming ceremony and dinner for her dear friends. From then on, Betty realized her passion and skills for wedding planning and later on took on that career path. Betty Anderson planned many weddings for the past 40 years and recently passed down her business to her two nieces Jade and Naomi as she gets ready to retire. For the past few years, “Marry Us” has been known worldwide and has planned celebrity weddings.  </p>
