    <p>DRAFT<BR>Electronic Mail (E-mail) became the most popular application
 
            Late 70s: Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis created USENET newsgroups, which allowed people all over the world to join discussion groups that talked about the Internet
             
            Rapid growth  in the late 70s and 80s driven by the popularity of e-mail
             
            1982: the term Internet was used for the first time
             
            1989: reaserchers at CERN High Ernergy physics laboratory in Geneva used HyperText, a new computer language, to create the World Wide Web, a combination of words, pictures and sounds
             
            1993: the first browser

        
            Larry roberts had the idea of making the network function by inserting a sub-network of smaller computers between the host computers
             
            Using digital technology to break up messages into discrete pieces that could be sent individually and then reassemled at the end point
             
            Baran: his work was done in response to the most dangerous situation that ever existed (the cold war). He is credited as having set internet's  ''blocks and stones''
             
            They talk about inventing the Internet as a way to (aller Ã  l'encontre) war, but Arpanet's intentions were truly to link computers at scientific laboratories across the country so that researchers might share ressources 
             
            The Intenet lacks a central founding figure
             
            But war always seemed to be somewhere behind the idea of Internet: The kennedy administration believed that computers would make it possible to control greater amount of information, and were a good prospectof solving problems that are of interest to the Department of Defense
             
            (The internet was tied to military concerns) 
             
            Without the deep war roots, we would never had the Internet
             
            In the late 60s, the White House pressured forces ARPA to tie its funding much more closely to military needs
             
            Inter-networking
             
            ARPANET began by connecting four universities. By 1971 it networked 23 ARPA-funded computer centers together.
            But there was a lot on censorship
             
            Alternatives: Usenet
