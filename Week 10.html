                                Lost Memories is a game created by Nina Freeman in 2017. About the meeting of a young 14-year-old teenager living in youth trials on the net. The player interacts with the girl's best friend through numerous online discussions. Dialogue is a central part of the game and aesthetics reminds the Internet of the early 2000s. I really enjoyed playing the game.
