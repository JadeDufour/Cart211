        <h2 class="h2">The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up</h2>
        <h4 class="h4">By Daniel Joseph</h4>
        <p class="p1">
            In the early 70s, canadian scientists and computer engineers conceived a network that could have sidestepped some of our actual problems with Internet. They called it TCCN. Indeed, Canada envisioned a system that did not rely on America and was not beholden to its whims. This great idea showed that another kind of Internet would have been (and still is) possible.<br>

            It was said that this national computer network would be managed as a federated system, with a "national spine" that would link together various regional network. But seeing the potential of this national spine, it would have soon been privatized by a single organization…<br>
            
            At the time, Canada was concerned that unchecked American capitalism would eat Canada's lunch if the US controlled the internet. While America’s ARPANET program was creating a precursor to today’s internet by networking military and academic computers with funding from the Department of Defense, Canada wanted to build its own nationwide system of networked computers that linked the country’s most powerful research computers. <br>
            
            Like every new technological improvement, people were were first reluctant and some were even worried that the government would use it to spy on them and collect date from them. The idea was abandoned in 73, instead, they implemented preferential treatment for Federal contracts and imported tariffs on foreign technology. Separately, The Canadian Universities Network ( a push from universities to link their computers in canada without going through Arpanet) was rejected in ‘72. But TCCN architects were not wrong to be concerned about a US led internet- improperly collecting data from Facebook has led to abuses of personal information<br>

            Nowadays, Canada is technologically dependent on the US (microsoft, google, facebook, twitter, youtube, etc)
            
            The US's repeal of net neutrality is a corporate capitulation that effectively threw down the gauntlet for Canada (which remains publicly committed to net neutrality despite pressure from entrenched interests)

        <h2 class="h2">From Counterculture to Cyberculture</h2>
        <h4 class="h4">By Fred Turner</h4>
        <p class="p1">
            <em><b>***A very long timelapse**</b></em><br><br>
           
                <strong>1950-1960:</strong> Computing equipment shrinked in size. They went from being room-sized mainframes to minicomputers that could fit beneath a desk.<br><br>
            
                <strong> Late 1950s:</strong> Computers processed information in batches of punched cards; a computer user had to prepare those cards and submit them to the managers of the machine for processing. <br><br>
                
                <strong>1958:</strong> ARPA was founded with the aim of sparking new research into defense-oriented technologies. <br><br>
                
                <strong>1960:</strong> In a highly influential paper entitled "Man-Computer Symbiosis," Licklider imagined a form of human-machine collaboration that surpassed even Vannevar Bush's vision for the Memex: "The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today."<br><br>
                
                <strong>1963: </strong> Much of the ARC group's work was funded by the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)<br><br>
                
                <strong>1966 -1968:</strong> ARC developed a collaborative office computing environment known as the On-Line System, or NLS. The NLS system featured many of the elements common to computer systems today, including not only the mouse, but a QWERTY keyboard and a CRT terminal<br><br>


                <strong>1968:</strong> On December 9 of that year, at the Association for Computing Machinery / Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (ACM/IEEE)–Computer Society's Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco, Engelbart and members of the ARC team demonstrated the NLS system to three thousand computer engineers. <br><br>
            
                <strong>Somewhere in the 70s:</strong> LSD and meetings in the woods of new Mexico, participants represented research institutes such as SRI and the Ecology Center and countercultural organizations such as Zomeworks (builders of domes). It also included highschool students and office designers<br><br>
                

                <strong>1970s:</strong> The <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em> came to model the potential integration of New Communalist ideals and information technology for researchers at Xerox PARC and for the leaders of the region's emerging computer hobbyist culture<br><br>
                

                
                <strong>1972:</strong> Foundation of the bimonthly newspaper, the People's Computer Company,
                Over the next five years, the newspaper became one of the first and most important information sources for hobbyists and others hoping to personalize their experience of computing. 
                (Founded by Bob Albercht,a former engineer for the Control Data Corporation and Honeywell, and his wife Mary Jo).<br><br>
                
                
                <em>This coming together fed back into the organizations involved. At the People's Computer Center, where members of Resource One and the hobbyist community often dropped by, the "Spacewar" article was posted on a bulletin board.</em><br><br>

                <hr class="hr">

                <br>

                <p class="p1">The title <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em> came from a previous project by Stewart Brand (american writer and editor of the WEC). In 1966, he initiated a public campaign to have NASA release the then-rumored satellite photo of the sphere of Earth as seen from space, the first image of the "Whole Earth." He thought the image might be a powerful symbol, evoking a sense of shared destiny and adaptive strategies from people.<br><br>
 
                The Catalog offered new ways to imagine the possibilities of computers and also legitimated the use of computers in nontraditional settings such as classrooms and public storefronts by linking those uses to a New Communalist ethos.</p>


                <hr class="hr">
                 
                <p class="p1"><em>So who created the idea of a personal computer, researchers or hobbyists?</em><br><br>
                Paul Ceruzzi, an american computer scientist, has claimed that "personal" computing emerged when time-sharing computers made it possible to imagine giving public users direct access to computers. Against these accounts, others have argued that the notion of the computer as a tool for personal and communal transformation first came to life outside the computer industry, among an insurgent group of hobbyists with countercultural loyalties. Members of this group, they point out, built the Homebrew Computer Club and ultimately not only Apple Computer, but a number of other important personal computer companies as well.<br><br>

                But one doesn’t go without the other, besides,  both parties even had their offices in the same area. In the Bay area in this period, the dynamic of personalization that had long been at work within some parts of the computer industry and the ideals of information sharing, individual empowerment, and collective growth that were alive within the counterculture and the hobbyist community did not so much compete with as complement each other. </p>
