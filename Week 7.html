            <p class="p1"><br><br><br>Written in 1974, Computer Lib explains how computers should become a conventional technology understood and used by everyone. The author tries to explain computers to the common man (or 'nitwit', to quote him). From the same year, Dream Machines, addresses the potential of computers to become engines of creativity, with graphics, multimedia, animation and hypertext.<br><br> Nelson himself calls his book "the most important book in the history of new media."  He states that everyone should understand computers in this day and age and he goes on with telling the reader how usefull these machines are (and will be) in our society. </p>
