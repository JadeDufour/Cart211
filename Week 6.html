                In this reading, Gavin Mueller talks about "proudhonism".  He discusses the meaning of the word, its origins, its founder ,the roots of digital proudhonism and what is proudhonism today. It it said that proudonism comes from Pierre Joseph Proudhon (father of anarchism and French politician) and his view on politics.   Mueller claims that he goal of this paper is not to question the creativity of remix culture or the maker movement, or to indict their potentials for artistic expression, but rather to criticize the outsized economic and political claims made about it. Throughout the text, Gavin Mueller dicusses Karl Marx's critique of Prouhon, and how Marx first tried to influence Proudhon but then became his most vehement critic since both men had very distingtives understandings of the new industrial society of the nineteenth century

                    <strong>1950-1960:</strong> Computing equipment shrinked in size. They went from being room-sized mainframes to minicomputers that could fit beneath a desk.<br><br>
    
    
                    <strong>1958:</strong> ARPA was founded with the aim of sparking new research into defense-oriented technologies. <br><br>
    
                    <strong>1963: </strong> Much of the ARC group's work was funded by the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)<br><br>
    
                    <strong>1966 -1968:</strong> ARC developed a collaborative office computing environment known as the On-Line System, or NLS. The NLS system featured many of the elements common to computer systems today, including not only the mouse, but a QWERTY keyboard and a CRT terminal<br><br>
    
    
                    <strong>1972:</strong> Foundation of the bimonthly newspaper, the People's Computer Company,
                    Over the next five years, the newspaper became one of the first and most important information sources for hobbyists and others hoping to personalize their experience of computing.

                    <em>This coming together fed back into the organizations involved. At the People's Computer Center, where members of Resource One and the hobbyist community often dropped by, the "Spacewar" article was posted on a bulletin board.</em><br><br>

                    <p class="p1">The title <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em> came from a previous project by Stewart Brand (american writer and editor of the WEC). In 1966, he initiated a public campaign to have NASA release the then-rumored satellite photo of the sphere of Earth as seen from space, the first image of the "Whole Earth." He thought the image might be a powerful symbol, evoking a sense of shared destiny and adaptive strategies from people.<br><br>
    
                    The Catalog offered new ways to imagine the possibilities of computers and also legitimated the use of computers in nontraditional settings such as classrooms and public storefronts by linking those uses to a New Communalist ethos.</p>
