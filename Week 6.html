            <h2 class="h2">GNU Manifesto</h2>
            <h4 class="h4">By Richard Stallman</h4>
            <p class="p1">

                
The GNU Manifesto begins with an explanation of what the GNU project is and the current state of play in creating the GNU operating system. 

The manifesto establishes a philosophical basis for launching the Unix project.
The author gives many reasons why the project and the freedom of the software are good for users, although he admits that its adoption will make a programmer's job less good.

            <h2 class="h2">Digital Proudhonism</h2>
            <h4 class="h4">By Gavin Mueller</h4>
            <p class="p1">
    
            In this reading, Gavin Mueller talks about "proudhonism".  He discusses the meaning of the word, its origins, its founder ,the roots of digital proudhonism and what is proudhonism today. It it said that proudonism comes from Pierre Joseph Proudhon (father of anarchism and French politician) and his view on politics.   Mueller claims that he goal of this paper is not to question the creativity of remix culture or the maker movement, or to indict their potentials for artistic expression, but rather to criticize the outsized economic and political claims made about it. Throughout the text, Gavin Mueller dicusses Karl Marx's critique of Prouhon, and how Marx first tried to influence Proudhon but then became his most vehement critic since both men had very distingtives understandings of the new industrial society of the nineteenth century
