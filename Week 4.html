        <p>In this text, Rachel Greene dicusses internet art as it emerges when artist began using the "early" internet using E-Mail, email-lists and html.

            In the described time-period it seems -to me- there are two very distinct things happening in parallel:
            
            On the one hand, in a generally offline artworld, some artists discovered and embraced a way to discuss art and present their own art on their own terms. As this community/these communities consisted of like-minded people, utopian thoughts on how this internet thing is going to open up the art world were shared and genuinely believed as no counter voices were present in the online dialog.
            
            On the other hand, a revolutionary new medium was discovered, explored and commented on. The exploration has since -of course- become part of everyday life and the exploration by both the artworld and the general public is still going strong.

                As opposed to what net.art used to be in its begginings, it is much harder to define nowadays; it is becoming more and more hybrid. 

                Our cultural landscape is now rife with references to digital visualizations, such as pixelization or the plastic colors and stiff lines of digital rendering. And the boundary between the “virtual” and the “real” is often blurred.
                
                "Exploring the real as virtual space"
                
                Unfortunately, net.art has become a minuscule market; very few people would pay for a piece that has been electronically shared several times. But it doesnt mean that artists are staying away from the internet. Artist are constantly finding new ways to innovate and bring life to their work. Rafael Rozendal found a way to monetize his work: by selling the ownership. Which changes the way we see creating art and making a living out of it.
