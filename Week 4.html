        <h2 class="h2">Web Work: A history of Net Art</h2>
        <h4 class="h4">By Rachel Greene</h4>


        <p class="p1">In this text, Rachel Greene dicusses internet art as it emerges when artist began using the "early" internet using E-Mail, email-lists and html.<br>

            She describes it as there are two very distinct things happening in parallel:<br>
            
            On the one hand, in a generally offline artworld, some artists discovered and embraced a way to discuss art and present their own art on their own terms. As they consisted of like-minded people.<br>
            
            On the other hand, a revolutionary new medium was discovered, explored and commented on. The exploration has since become part of everyday life and the exploration by both the artworld and the general public is still going strong.

                <h2 class="h2">The New World of Net Art</h2>
                <h4 class="h4">By Carolina Miranda</h4>
                <p class="p1">
                As opposed to what net.art used to be in its begginings, it is much harder to define nowadays; it is becoming more and more hybrid. <br>

                Our cultural landscape is now rife with references to digital visualizations, such as pixelization or the plastic colors and stiff lines of digital rendering. And the boundary between the “virtual” and the “real” is often blurred.<br>
                
                "Exploring the real as virtual space"<br>
                
                Unfortunately, net.art has become a minuscule market; very few people would pay for a piece that has been electronically shared several times. But it doesnt mean that artists are staying away from the internet. Artist are constantly finding new ways to innovate and bring life to their work. <br>
